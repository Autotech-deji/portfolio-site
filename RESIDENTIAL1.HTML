         The client is a reputable business man whose aim and purpose is to have 
         a confortable duplex for himself and the family without having much decking on the 
         first floor.As a result of this,we were given the brief and we came up with 
         sketches and presentation drawings after which this particular design was picked 
         by the client for the best fit.after some corrections on the floor plans we finally 
         agreed on this as our final design.
